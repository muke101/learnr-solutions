Please see below for a list of questions to test your programming skills! Corresponding solutions are in the folder above. All solutions are written by Luke Panayi.

1. `Write an if statement with the condition that 10 divided by 5 is equal to 2. Have your program then print ‘true!’ when this is seen to be true.`

2. `Write an if statement with the condition that 10 divided by 5 is equal to 3. Use an else statement to have your program print ‘false!’.`

3. `Define the variables ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘z’. Assign them the numbers 10, 5 and 2 in whichever order you like, and then rewrite the first two exercises using these variables.`

4. `In the above exercise, what happens when you change the value of your variable with holds 2 to 3?`

5. `Write an if statement which is true if the remainder of 10 divided by 5 is 0. (hint: you can use the ‘modulus’ operator, the % symbol, to find the reminder of a division. ie: 2 % 1 = 0, 3 % 2 =1).`

6. `Write a while loop which counts to 100, printing out each number as it goes along.`

7. `Using the ‘range’ function, rewrite the above exercise using a for loop.`

8. `Using either a for loop or a while loop, create an empty list and add all the odd numbers to it as your loop counts to 100. Print the list after the loop is complete. (You may want to use the modulus operator again)`

9. `Do the above exercise, but use an if statement using a modulus operator to only add the odd number to the list if it is a multiple of 3. (hint: you can combine condition checks in the same if statement using ‘and’ and ‘or’ keywords!)`

10. `Do the above exercise, but only add the odd number when it is *not* a multiple of 3.`

11. `write a loop which counts from 1 to 100. For each number, if it is a multiple of 3, print ‘fizz’. If it is a multiple of 5, print ‘buzz’. If it is a multiple of 3 and 5 at the same time, print ‘fizzbuzz’. (The ‘elif’ keyword may come in handy)`

12. `Do the above exercise but print out each number besides the ‘fizz’, ‘buzz’, or ‘fizzbuzz’ that was found to be a multiple of 3, 5 or both.`

13. `Take your whole list of odd numbers from earlier and remove every element that is a multiple of 5`

14. `Take this list and print only the first 5 numbers without changing the list (hint: use list slices)`

15. `Take this list and print only the last 5 numbers without changing the list.`

16. `Print the whole list *except* the first and last 5 numbers without changing the list.`

17. `Write a function which prints ‘hello’. Call this function ‘hello’.`

18. `Write a function which takes one argument and prints it. Call this function ‘echo’.`

19. `Write a function which *returns* a number you give it multiplied by itself. Call this function ‘square’.`

20. `Write a function which returns ‘true’ if a number you give it is even, and false if it is odd. What should this function be called?`

21. `Rewrite your fizzbuzz loop inside a function, and have the number it counts to (previously 100) be controlled by an argument you pass to the function.`

22. `Write the parts of your fizzbuzz loops which check if a number is a multiple of 3, 5 or both as three separate functions which return true or false (return, not print). Use these functions in the if statements of your fizzbuzz function.`

23. `Write a function which takes a number of returns it’s factorial using a for loop. (A factorial is every integer before a given integer up to 1 multiplied together, so for example the factorial of 5 would be 5*4*3*2*1=120)`

24. `Write the same function again, but instead of using a for loop, try and have the function call itself each time. So, factorial 5 would go to 5*(factorial 4), to 5*4*(factorial 3) and so on. Have the original function call return at the end the total value. (this is a hard exercise, don’t be afraid to look for help online!)`

25. `Using the data provided (see "5 Day Moving Average Exercise.csv") please calculate the 5 day average for the share price of each of the companies, based on your calculations, rank each firm based on their average.`
